# 100 Days Of Code - Leif Latiff - Log
My name is Leif. I'm a Javascript enthusiast. Know me better at fishingelephants[dot]com.

I've taken the 100 Days of Code challenge on January 1st, 2018 and this is where I publish my daily progress.

### Day 6: January 6th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 1st new rule for the Pig Game
- A player looses his ENTIRE score when he rolls two 6 in a row. Then the next player's turn.

**Thoughts:** 
- Good practice and understanding by modifying the game's rule play.

**Link to work:** I will push this to github at some point of the course.

### Day 5: January 5th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completing the Pig Game
- New Game button
- Put all scores to 0
- Remove 'winner' and 'active' & add active player to player 1
- Deactivate buttons when winner found

**Thoughts:** 
- I'm able to memorized previous functions/codes

**Link to work:** I will push this to github at some point of the course.

### Day 4: January 4th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Javascript Events/Events Handler for Pig Game
- Rolling the dice function
- Put all scores to 0
- Updating scores and changing the active player
- Implement 'Hold' function and the DRY principle

**Thoughts:** 
- Beginning to understand more
- The game became apparent and fun

**Link to work:** I will push this to github at some point of the course.

### Day 3: January 3rd, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Javascript DOM and Pig Game
- Learned more about DOM manipulation and events
- Setup mini project Pig Game with DOM:
- Pig Game - To put random scores and display it on each players
- Pig Game - To set dice to not visible during start

**Thoughts:** 
- To be honest, I didn't really pay attention on DOM and was eager to start the project.
- Seriously I just can't focus during theories/lectures.

**Link to work:** I will push this to github at some point of the course.

### Day 2: January 2nd, 2018

**Today's Progress:** How Javascript Works & working on BIL Portfolio
- The 'this' keyword & in practice (How JS Works)
- Added more photos in gallery (BIL)

**Thoughts:** 
- Having hard time understanding the 'this' method. 
- Currently stuck in adding to display images from a folder.

**Link to work:** I will push this to github at some point of the course.

### Day 1: January 1st, 2018

**Today's Progress:** How Javascript Works
- Javascript Parsers and Engines
- Execution contexts and the Execution Stack
- Hoisting in practice
- Scoping and the Scope Chain

**Thoughts:** Better understanding on the theories. I would normally skip these and go straight to coding but knowing there will be some codes at the end, so I waited. 

**Link to work:** I will push this to github at some point of the course.
