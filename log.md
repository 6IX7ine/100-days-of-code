# 100 Days Of Code - Leif Latiff - Log
My name is Leif. I'm a Javascript enthusiast. Know me better at fishingelephants[dot]com.

I've taken the 100 Days of Code challenge on January 1st, 2018 and this is where I publish my daily progress.

### Day 2: January 2nd, 2018

**Today's Progress:** How Javascript Works & working on BIL Portfolio
- The 'this' keyword & in practice (How JS Works)
- Added more photos in gallery (BIL)

**Thoughts:** 
- Having hard time understanding the 'this' method. 
- Currently stuck in adding to display images from a folder.

**Link to work:** I will push this to github at some point of the course.

### Day 1: January 1st, 2018

**Today's Progress:** How Javascript Works
- Javascript Parsers and Engines
- Execution contexts and the Execution Stack
- Hoisting in practice
- Scoping and the Scope Chain

**Thoughts:** Better understanding on the theories. I would normally skip these and go straight to coding but knowing there will be some codes at the end, so I waited. 

**Link to work:** I will push this to github at some point of the course.
